## Hi there, my name is Yuncong Yu <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

I am a current USC graduate student studying computer science. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Machine Learning Projects that involve predictive modeling and fun datasets like gamma rays and bike rentals!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development and computer network protocols.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, innovative ML applications, or anything that combines creativity and code.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning image classification, how to tune model using already classified frames.  
- 💬 Ask me about surviving grad school at USC.
