## Hi there, my name is Yuncong Yu <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

<br>

I'm a current Computer Science graduate student at the University of Southern California (USC). My passion lies in leveraging data and advanced machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems, aka let machines do the work for us.


- 🔭 I'm currently working on Deep Learning models focusing on audio and speech processing, including text-to-speech models and generating synthetic datasets with these models.
- 🌱 I’m actively diving deeper into deep learning applications, particularly in the realm of audio processing.
- 👯 I'm eager to gain a more comprehensive understanding of various audio models such as AudioDec, SoundStream, ChatterBox-TTS, and Index-TTS.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to be a long-haul truck driver.
